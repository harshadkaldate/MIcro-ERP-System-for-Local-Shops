# MIcro-ERP-System-for-Local-Shops
RetailCore is a specialized Micro-ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system engineered to digitize the operations of unorganized "Kirana" (local) stores in India. Built entirely in C, the system provides a high-performance, zero-cost alternative to expensive billing software that often requires high-end hardware.

Digitizing the Backbone of Indian Retail:
RetailCore is a high-performance, lightweight inventory and billing engine built entirely in C. It is specifically designed for unorganized retail shops (Kiranas) that currently rely on manual "Khata" books.

Key Features

Hybrid Inventory Logic: Unlike standard apps, RetailCore uses float-based stock tracking (e.g., selling 0.250kg of Sugar), eliminating "weight-loss" errors.
"Dukan Alert" System: Implements a threshold algorithm to automatically generate restocking "Shopping Lists".
Atomic Saves & Persistence: Uses a portable CSV database with instant disk synchronization to prevent data loss during power cuts.
Legacy Hardware Support: Engineered for 15-year-old PCs (Pentium 4) with 0.01s search latency for 2,500+ items
